I am an AI researcher and founder.

This site is an independent writing project about long-term change — how artificial intelligence reshapes institutions, markets, incentives, and individual agency.

AI is not just a technology wave. It is a structural shift in capability distribution. It changes who can build, who can coordinate, and who can scale. It compresses time-to-execution and amplifies leverage. The implications are economic, geopolitical, and deeply personal.

The writing here focuses on:

* Second-order effects of AI deployment
* Long-term strategy under accelerating capability
* What founders should build
* How individuals can position themselves
* Where asymmetry and leverage are emerging

This is not a news commentary site. It is a place to think clearly about durable advantage, system design, and long-term optionality.

Some essays are published in both English and Chinese.
